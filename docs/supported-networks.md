HyperIndex currently supports indexing on any EVM-compatible network an RPC endpoint.

The secret of HyperIndexâ€™s sync speed lies in using Hypersync for data retrieval. See here for networks that are supported on [HyperSync](./hypersync.md).
This method is significantly more efficient than traditional RPC methods, as it allows the retrieval of multiple blocks at once, allowing for blazing-fast retrieval of data (100x faster than RPC).

If the network that you want to index from is not supported on HyperSync, please navigate to [RPC Sync Configuration](./sync-config.md) for more information.
