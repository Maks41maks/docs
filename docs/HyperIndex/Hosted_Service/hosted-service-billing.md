> TLDR: It's free, at some point we will charge and the pricing will be sustainable and if you don't agree you can simply self host the indexer.

We are working to refine our pricing model, on the path to a sustainable start up. Our current focus is in building the best product out there. As such we don't want to create any barriers to entry and as such our pricing is free.

Of course this is not a sustainable model and so at some point we will implement a paid service. Likely a tiered approach with a free tier. Picture pricing that supports the needs of Indie Chad Devs to Bluechip's such as Aave, Uniswap or Safe.

We are dedicated to working along app teams, developers and data analysts to ensure that the pricing is sustainable.
