# Configuration File

The `config.yaml` contains various information about the smart contract project, including network specifications and event information to be fed into the indexing process.

Example `config.yaml` from Greeter scenario:

```yaml
version: 0.0.0
description: Greeter indexer
repository: https://github.com/PaulRBerg/hardhat-template
networks:
  - id: 1337
    rpc_url: http://localhost:8545
    start_block: 0
    contracts:
      - name: Greeter
        abi_file_path: abis/greeter-abi.json
        address: ["0x2B502ab6F783c2Ae96A75dc68cf82a77ce2637c2"]
        handler: ./src/EventHandlers.bs.js
        events:
          - event: "NewGreeting"
            requiredEntities:
              - name: "Greeting"
                labels:
                  - "greetingWithChanges"
          - event: "ClearGreeting"
