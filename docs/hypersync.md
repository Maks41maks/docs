# Hypersync

> Beam me up, scotty! ðŸ––

Envio hypersync is our blazingly fast indexed layer on top of the blockchain that allows for hyper speed syncing.

What would usually take hours to sync ~100,000 events can now be done in the order of less than a minute.

Since this service is a layer above the blockchain we maintain and host this service for each supported network.
