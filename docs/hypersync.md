# Hypersync

> Beam me up, scotty! ðŸ––

Envio hypersync is our blazingly fast indexed layer on top of the blockchain that allows for hyper speed syncing.

What would usually take hours to sync ~100,000 events can now be done in the order of less than a minute.

Since this service is a layer above the blockchain we maintain and host this service for each supported network.

Below is a table of networks supported on our hypersync feature

| Network Name     | ID    |
| ---------------- | ----- |
| Ethereum Mainnet | 1     |
| Optimism         | 10    |
| Bsc              | 56    |
| Matic            | 137   |
| ArbitrumOne      | 42161 |
| Avalanche        | 43114 |
| BaseTestnet      | 84531 |
| Linea            | 59144 |

> Disclaimer: currently the hypersync feature is not real-time - it intentionally lags 10 blocks behind the latest block to allow for chain reorganizations in the future.
