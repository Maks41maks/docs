# Hypersync

> Beam me up, scotty! ðŸ––

Envio hypersync is our blazingly fast indexed layer on top of the blockchain that allows for hyper speed syncing.

What would usually take hours to sync ~100,000 events can now be done in the order of less than a minute.

Since this service is a layer above the blockchain we maintain and host this service for each supported network.

Here is a table of currently supported networks on Hypersync:

## Greeter example

```yaml
name: Greeter
description: Greeter indexer
networks:
  - id: 137 # Polygon
    start_block: 0
    contracts:
      - name: PolygonGreeter
        abi_file_path: abis/greeter-abi.json
        address: "0x9D02A17dE4E68545d3a58D3a20BbBE0399E05c9c"
        handler: ./src/EventHandlers.bs.js
        events:
          - event: "NewGreeting"
            requiredEntities:
              - name: "Greeting"
                labels:
                  - "greetingWithChanges"
          - event: "ClearGreeting"
            requiredEntities:
              - name: "Greeting"
                labels:
                  - "greetingWithChanges"
```

In the example above, absence of `rpc_config` will automatically direct Envio to HyperSync for the defined network (Polygon).

For HyperSync users can use `start_block` of 0 regardless of when the deployments for the contracts to be indexed were, as HyperSync can very quickly detect the first block where it needs to start indexing from automatically.
