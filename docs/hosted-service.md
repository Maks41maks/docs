<sub><sup> NOTE: Our hosted service is still in beta ðŸ‘· </sup></sub>

## Overview

Envio's hosted service is the easiest way to deploy and host your indexer. We provide the entire infrastructure for hosting and users are just required to push the latest versions of their indexer to GitHub for deployment.

## Deploying an indexer to the hosted service

1. [Login with GitHub](https://envio.dev/app/login)
1. Add an organisation or your personal GitHub user profile

1. Create a deployment branch

> For subsequent releases, we recommend setting branch protection rules that prevent direct pushes to your release branch. Instead, making pull requests from a feature branch into the release branch is recommendedðŸ““


## Deployment limits

Developers can deploy 3 indexers per organisation and 3 deployments per indexer. Deployments can be deleted in the hosted service to make space for more deployments.

## Pricing

The hosted service is currently a free service. We are currently refining the pricing tiers and are dedicated to working along app teams and developers to ensure that the pricing is sustainable.
