HyperSync is the state of the art way to extract on-chain data to JSON, Arrow or Parquet.

HyperIndex heavily relies on HyperSync in order to index more than 100x faster than traditional indexing tools.

This API has been designed from the ground up to provide both speed and felxiblity.

The goal is that this API will be the defacto faster and most flexible way for you to extract any onchain data that you need.
