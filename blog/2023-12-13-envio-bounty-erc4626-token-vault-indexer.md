We‚Äôre excited to announce another significant milestone in Phase 1 of the Envio Bounty Program. We take huge pride in highlighting the latest achievement in our bounty program, where our very talented graduate ‚Äúen0c‚Äù successfully tackled a significant challenge.

In this blog article, we‚Äôll explore their recent accomplishment in building an Envio indexer for [OpenZeppelin‚Äôs](https://www.openzeppelin.com/) ERC4626 tokenized vault contracts, showcasing the true power of Envio's hyper-indexing capabilities. ‚ö°‚ö°‚ö°

### User Story

This bounty aimed to tackle the challenges that blockchain developers face when wanting to query and/or present tokenized vault events in their applications. The goal was to enable developers to easily query and/or present tokenized vault events in their applications with custom [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) APIs.

### Bounty Overview

For blockchain developers seeking an easy and efficient way to access information for tokenized vault contracts in their applications can be quite a cumbersome task. Our recent bounty introduced an indexer template tailored for OpenZeppelin‚Äôs ERC4626 tokenized vault contract standard. This template aims to bootstrap development time by indexing token vault events without the need to write the indexing logic by providing a pre-built solution for indexing OpenZeppelins‚Äôs token vault events.

The ERC4626 tokenized vault standard extends the functionality of the ERC20 standard by allowing fractionalized token supply through deposits and withdrawals to token vaults. The bounty included the development of a GraphQL schema, an Envio configuration file, and indexing logic in [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/). In addition, Envio indexer supports indexing logic in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) or [Rescript](https://rescript-lang.org/).

The schema includes three main types: `TokenVault`, `Deposit`, and `Withdrawal`. The `TokenVault` entity stores information about the tokenized vault, such as assets, shares, proportions, and exchange rates. `Deposit` and `Withdrawal` entities capture details about corresponding events, including sender, owner, assets, shares, and the associated vault.

**From Development to Deployment**

Our accomplished bounty graduate, "en0c," seamlessly deployed their ERC4626 indexer onto Envio's hosted service by effortlessly pushing the latest version of their [indexer project](https://github.com/en0c-026/erc4626-indexer) to GitHub.

You can now explore the full functionalities of the ERC4626 token vault indexer, accessible in [Envio's Explorer](https://envio.dev/explorer).

In addition, our graduate demonstrated what a few GraphQL API queries would look like below:

*Query Example: Get Vault State*
