Envio and Azuro are excited to announce a groundbreaking collaboration that invites all passionate blockchain developers who are interested, to apply for a unique grant opportunity! The premise is simple yet handsomely rewarding:

Build an open-source multi-chain indexer for the Azuro Protocol using the Envio SDK and receive a grant of **$1500 USDC**! üí∏

## Grant Overview

Azuro uses subgraphs (indexing framework from TheGraph), to index and organize data from Azuro smart contracts to query specific information about games, conditions, bets, and bet results.

The grant challenge involves migrating/replicating the indexing logic from Azuro‚Äôs subgraphs to the Envio SDK. The resulting Envio indexer should match the GraphQL API of the subgraphs as closely as possible, by migrating the schema.graphql file.

A strategic difference that needs to be taken into consideration is that Azuro currently uses an individual subgraph for each chain deployment to index and organize data from the Azuro smart contracts. This means there is an individual GraphQL API for each chain deployment to query Azuro data.

Envio‚Äôs multi-chain indexing simplifies this process, by empowering developers with a seamless way to aggregate fragmented data stored across multiple chains into the same database using a single indexer deployment. This capability makes accessing Azuro data on multiple blockchains effortless through a single, unified GraphQL API.

The Azuro open-source multi-chain indexer aims to serve as an alternative endpoint to access and query Azuro‚Äôs smart contract data.

### Technical Scope

- The scope of the multi-chain indexer is limited to Gnosis and Polygon production contract deployments.
- The event handlers of the Envio indexer should be written in TypeScript.
- The indexer involves configuring schema.graphql, config.yaml, and handlers.ts files
- Envio SDK version for the indexer should be version 0.0.29 or higher.

## How to Apply for a Grant?

If you are keen to take on this opportunity, you can apply by completing the [Google Form](https://forms.gle/F4FCSiTbrYAgnqsn9).

**Please do not start the grant without approval.**

After completing the Google Form, please allow up to 48 hours for your application to be reviewed. The Envio and Azuro teams will review your application and get in touch with you upon acceptance via the contact details provided in the form.

Upon acceptance:

- You will have up to 4 weeks to complete the grant.
- You will be added to a dedicated private support channel in the Envio Discord for support, questions, and communication with the Envio and Azuro team during the duration of the grant.
- You can fork this [starter kit boilerplate](https://github.com/enviodev/azuro-envio-indexer-boilerplate) to start the grant

Please note:

- Developers with prior subgraph/indexer development experience will be given priority.

## Acceptance criteria

- The resulting code should build and run correctly
- The resulting code should have high code quality (readability, simplicity, comments where necessary)
- The resulting code should have basic tests in place to validate events are being processed correctly
- The resulting code should be accompanied by sample GraphQL queries that touch on every schema entity, which can be listed in README.md
- The resulting code should be in a public GitHub repository with a suitable open-source license recognized by the OSI
- The indexer should be deployed to Envio‚Äôs hosted service

Upon project submission, please allow up to 3 working days (72 hours) for reviewing the resulting code. If necessary, some additional time will be agreed upon for corrections.

The grantee will be featured in a case study article and also have the opportunity to talk/ present at a community call (TBC).
