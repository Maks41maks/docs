Are you intrigued by the world of blockchain and eager to dive into the exciting realm of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts? This introductory guide will walk you through the key concepts and technologies required to start your journey as a blockchain developer. We'll also introduce you to Envio, a game-changing blockchain indexing toolkit designed to streamline your developer experience and optimize your dApp and smart contract design.

## What are Decentralized Applications (dApps)?

A decentralized application, often referred to as “dApp”, is an application built on a decentralized network and combines a frontend user interface (e.g. web application) and smart contract.

Some popular dApps include [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), the most popular decentralized exchange; [Aave](https://aave.com/), a borrowing and lending protocol; and [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/), an NFT marketplace. Uniswap, at the time of writing, is deployed on 9 Blockchains, such as [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/), [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/), [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/), [Base](https://base.org/), and more.

### What is a Frontend?

The frontend is the part of the DApp end-users can see and interact with such as the graphical user interface (GUI), much like traditional web applications. In Web3 or blockchain, the frontend additionally communicates with the application logic defined in smart contracts.

### What is a Smart Contract?

Smart contracts are the building blocks of dApps and are self-executing, code-based agreements that run on a blockchain. They are designed to operate without an intermediary, meaning they can run self-sufficiently on a decentralized network (i.e. the blockchain) instead of a single computer or server controlled by a central authority - a fundamental innovation in the world of blockchain technology.

Smart contracts automatically enforce predefined rules and conditions, executing actions when specific criteria are met. These contracts eliminate the need for intermediaries, enhancing trust, security, and efficiency in digital transactions. Smart contracts find applications in various industries beyond finance, offering tamper-proof automation and transparency.

### Communication between the Frontend and Smart Contract

Frontend applications (e.g. web applications) communicate with a smart contract on the blockchain via a node. This is because the blockchain is a decentralized network composed of nodes that all run the same software and keep a copy of all states of the blockchain - including the data and code associated with every smart contract. On Ethereum, this is known as the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine).

The nodes one connects with are often called “node providers'' or “RPC providers”. These node providers implement a JSON-RPC specification, ensuring a uniform set of methods when frontend applications interact with the smart contracts deployed onto the runtime environment of the blockchain.

You can access the information stored on the blockchain by connecting to it through a node provider like [Infura](https://www.infura.io/). However, if you want to make changes to the blockchain's data, you'll need an additional component. When you want to interact with a smart contract on the blockchain, it's called a transaction. To perform a transaction, a user or application must sign it using their private key, a fundamental concept of blockchain and cryptography. Developers use a wallet to sign transactions on the blockchain.

## Understanding Programming Languages for Blockchain Development

Before diving into blockchain development, it's essential to know the lingo. There are plenty of different programming languages readily available, but let's explore some commonly used in blockchain development: [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/), [JavaScript](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/terminology#javascript), and [](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/terminology#rescript)[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). We'll dive into their unique characteristics and how they fit into the blockchain development landscape and developer experience.

### **Solidity:**

- Solidity is a high-level programming language specifically designed for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
- It is statically typed and compiled, not interpreted.
- Primarily used for creating smart contracts that run on EVM-compatible blockchains.
- It has become the standard language for Ethereum smart contract development.

### **JavaScript:**

- JavaScript is a high-level interpreted programming language widely used in blockchain development.
- Primarily used for client-side scripting in web browsers.
- Enables developers to create interactive and dynamic Web3 applications.
- It has been the standard language for web development for a significant period.

### Rust:

- Rust is a systems programming language known for its safety and performance.
- Primarily used for low-level system software development, e.g. operating systems and embedded systems.
- Rust's ownership system and borrow checker help prevent memory-related errors, making it a reliable choice for critical applications.
- It has gained recognition in blockchain development, notably in projects like Polkadot and Solana, where security and performance are critical in decentralized networks.
- We, at Envio, use it for its raw speed in our `envio` CLI tool, and teams like [Paradigm](https://www.paradigm.xyz/) use it with [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry), a blazingly fast smart contract development framework.

## DApp Development

Now this is where the rubber meets the road! Utilizing developer tools and languages can be highly beneficial to the development process, meaning that prior knowledge of [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) are highly valuable skill and sure does come in handy when developing dApps.

Below, we'll guide you through some core fundamentals and prerequisite packages required before setting sail on your development journey to become a proficient blockchain application developer.

### Setting up your development environment

Before you can start building dApps, you'll need to set up your development environment. This typically involves installing some necessary software and tools such as:

- Setting up an integrated development environment (IDE). [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a brilliant software tool that helps programmers develop software code efficiently and has support for almost every major programming language. VS Code also provides integrations with Web3 technologies like Hardhat for an optimal and inclusive developer experience.
- Setting up [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current), a JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code on the server side. It's essential for running various development tools and server applications, like your web application.
- Installing a smart contract development framework. [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) are all smart contract development platforms that help blockchain developers test, compile, deploy, and debug their smart contracts onto the blockchain.
- The next important dependency for developing Web3 dApps is a local network such as the [Hardhat Network](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/docs/HyperIndex/overview), or Foundry’s [Anvil](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/crates/anvil), which offers you a private blockchain for creating, testing, compiling, and deploying smart contracts. You can use a local network as a viable resource for accessing a safe testing environment to evaluate your smart contracts and decentralized applications.

**Writing, deploying, and testing smart contracts**

Backend development in blockchain involves creating smart contracts and indexing data from said smart contracts. After development, you'll deploy your smart contracts to the blockchain, making them live and accessible to users. Extensive testing is paramount to ensure that your contracts behave as intended. Undergoing a smart contract audit is also highly recommended, especially if your smart contracts hold users’ funds.

**Interfacing with smart contracts**

Smart contracts are at the heart of many blockchain applications. To interact with them, you'll use code libraries like [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.10.0/#) or [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/). These libraries use JSON-RPC requests to a specific Ethereum node through JSON APIs and allow your frontend code to communicate with smart contracts on the blockchain, enabling actions like sending transactions and retrieving data.

**Handling transactions and wallet integrations**

DApps often need to integrate with wallets in order to create or sign transactions. You'll need to integrate wallet solutions like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) or [Rabby](https://rabby.io/) into your frontend. This will enable secure transactions and interactions on the blockchain.

**Ensuring security and best practices**

Security is hugely important when developing your blockchain applications. Be sure to follow the best practices when it comes to protecting your smart contracts and dApps from vulnerabilities and attacks. These techniques include code audits, secure coding practices, and thorough testing.

**Managing blockchain data**

Blockchain applications often deal with enormous amounts of data. This data management is essential for creating functional and responsive dApps. Backend development in Web3 applications can be quite challenging and time-consuming for a developer, often leading to a slower development process. This is where Envio comes into the picture, simplifying the developer process and experience, and making developers way more efficient.
